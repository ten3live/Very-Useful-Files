Yes, it is possible to run React Native apps on your mobile device over Wi-Fi using ADB. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

Steps to Enable ADB Over Wi-Fi
Connect Your Device via USB

Plug your mobile device into your laptop using a USB cable.
Ensure that USB Debugging is enabled on your mobile device.
Verify ADB Connection

Open a terminal or command prompt on your laptop and type:
bash
Copy code
adb devices
Your device should appear in the list.
Enable ADB Over Wi-Fi

Run the following command to get your device's IP address:
bash
Copy code
adb shell ip addr show wlan0
Look for your device's IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.5).
Disconnect the USB cable.
Connect ADB to Your Device Over Wi-Fi

Use the following command to connect to your device:
bash
Copy code
adb connect 192.168.137.75:24
Replace <device-ip> with the IP address of your device.
Verify the Wi-Fi Connection

Run the adb devices command again to ensure your device is connected over Wi-Fi.
Run Your React Native App

Start the React Native development server:
bash
Copy code
npx react-native start
Run the app on your device:
bash
Copy code
npx react-native run-android
Notes
Both your mobile device and your laptop must be on the same Wi-Fi network for this to work.
If your Wi-Fi network changes, you might need to reconnect your device using the steps above.
If you encounter issues, try restarting the adb server:
bash
Copy code
adb kill-server
adb start-server
